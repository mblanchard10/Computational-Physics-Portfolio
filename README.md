This repository is a collection of my work from my Computational Physics class of my Junior year at High Point University. Throughout this course my professor, Dr. Aaron Titus, focused on a variety of topics including solving ODE's, drag, Magnus Effect, oscillations, waves and so many more topics. I am proud to present my work as this is an excellent to show off the knowledge I have gained throughout the semester. 

As a computer science major who has never taken a physics class, I found this course to be quite challenging at times. Although I believe there is plenty of room to improve my talent in the subject of Physics, I believe I have demonstrated decent knowledge in a variety of the topics we learned. 

I want to give credit to my lab partner, Reilly Kobbe. Reilly and I worked together on each of these projects throughout the semester. As we both major in computer science, we were able to put our heads together to figure out the physics. For us, the coding was far less difficult. We made an excellent team and truly demonstrated the positive outcomes of team engineering. 

**My Projects**

**1. Plinko Board** - Here we modeled a plinko board. This project gave us an introduction to collision code and how gravity has an effect on mass. We took a sample of times it took for the ball to reach the bottom. From there, we derived a histograph from out data. 

**2. Double Pendeulum** - In this project, Reilly and I modeled a double pendulum. This was our introduction to ODE's, as we included the RK4 method in our code. We investigated the effects certain constants such as the mass of the ball or length of the rod had on the movement of the pendulum. 

**3. Trajectory of a Curveball Pitch** - For our third project we modeled the trajctory of a curveball pitch. This project allowed us to study Magnus Effect and drag. We were able to use differential equations and an RK4 model ODE to model a curveball pitch.

**4. Coupled Oscillators** - Our third project was a model of coupled oscillators. This project involved the study of oscillations and waves. The goal of this project was to model violin strings.

**5. Brownian Motion** - Our final semester project was to research and model Brownian Motion. We did this by modeling a pollen particle in water. We used Monte Carlo to model the randomness in all of the water particles. - https://github.com/mblanchard10/final.git
